## How can I use Gravita?

Gravita enables users to borrow funds by using their LSTs as collateral. To get started, users can deposit their liquid staking tokens into the Gravita protocol and receive GRAI stablecoin in return. The amount of GRAI they can borrow depends on the value of their collateral, and can be up to 90% of its worth.

## What are the key benefits of Gravita?

Gravita not only provides users with interest-free loans, but also helps to improve decentralization by supporting multiple LSTs as collateral, allowing users to borrow against a variety of assets while maintaining separate positions for each. This approach promotes diversity in the crypto ecosystem and supports the growth of high-quality minority LSTs.

Additionally, Gravita is non-custodial, programmatic, and transparent, upholding the ideals of decentralized finance.

## How can I earn money on Gravita?

Users can earn money on Gravita by providing liquidity to the Stability Pool. The Stability Pool is used to help repay the debts of liquidated Vessels that fall below the minimum collateral ratio. Over time, Stability Providers may earn early adopter rewards and may also make liquidation gains.

Gravita has plans to introduce its governance token, GRVT, in the future, which may be used to provide benefits such as boosted yields and reduced fees. However, the platform will launch without the governance token initially.
