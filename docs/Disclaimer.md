### 1. Description

Gravita Protocol is a novel, decentralized borrowing protocol that allows users to deposit assets and borrow the protocol’s native stablecoin, GRAI, against them. The Gravita Protocol protocol is made up of both proprietary and free, public, and open-source software.Your use of Gravita Protocol involves various risks, including, but not limited, to losses while digital assets are deposited into Gravita Protocol via smart contract or economic exploits, and losses due to liquidations and redemptions. Before borrowing, staking, or liquidity providing you should fully review our technical documentation to understand how the Gravita Protocol protocol works.

### 2. Audits

While the Gravita Protocol Decentralized Finance Protocol has been thoroughly audited by multiple independent software security firms and undergone third-party economic analysis, there remains a risk that assets deposited into the protocol as well as the GRAI and GRVT tokens may suffer complete and permanent economic loss should the protocol’s technical or economic mechanisms suffer catastrophic failure.
